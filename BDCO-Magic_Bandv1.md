**Big Data Community Outreach Magic Band Session**
Lesson Objectives:
By the end of the class, the student will be able to……..
1.	Talk about wearable technology
2.	Identify some challenges of sensor data
3.	Identify some impacts of sensor data on daily life
4.	Identify what to study in school if you want a career in STEM

Target Audience: 5-8 Grade Students
Time Frame: 55 Minutes

Time	Lesson Plan	Instructor Notes
**5 min	Intro yourself & why you are here**
•	Name, company, role, what you studied in school
•	STEM
•	Something cool about yourself & what you do at EMC
•	Transition to wearable technology	Engage Students by asking:
•	Share something fun and personal - get them interested.

**Introductory Activity 3-4 mins	Activity Set Up**

Tell Class:  Today we are going to plan a trip to Disney Land. One of the things you can do when you plan ahead is get a Disney Magic Band. 
Disney Magic Bands are these rubber wrist bands that are designed to create a better customer experience. They act as:
•	Park Entry
•	Location Tracking
•	Hotel Keys
•	Payment method (credit card link)
•	Special Activity Passes
•	Customer Sentiment
•	Restaurant reservations

Your objective is to have the most amount of fun in a span of 6 hours in the park.	*Engage Students by asking:*
*•	Who has been to Disney Land?*
*•	Have you ever tried magic bands?*
*•	Who are your favorite Disney characters?*
*•	What are your favorite rides?*

**10 mins	Activity – 10 minutes**

1.	Tell Class:  
•	Have students count off to determine groups.  See right column
•	Have student get into their groups
•	Group names are sequential (1,2,3)



2.	Tell Class:  Each group will be given a map of Disney Land and a sheet of wait times for the most popular rides.  As a group chose which rides you want to ride in order to maximize your fun. Rank your favorite rides as you go.  

*Teacher directions for #2:*  
*•	Hand each group the map and timetable.*

Tell Class:  
•	Each group chooses the rides they want to ride in order.
•	You have to ride each group member’s favorite ride 
•	At the end, each group will share the number of rides they rode and the amount of time it took.

3.	Tell Class:  What if we had all of this data in real time? What if we could plug in our favorite rides, and we had an app on our phone calculate how we could have the most fun.  What about other things we could do with all of the data the bands are collecting?

*Teacher directions for #3:  *
*•	Show output of an optimized ride configuration based on ride times.*
*•	Write out the ideas that the kids come up with*
*•	Talk about privacy vs experience *

**Intro Activity Close:**

4.	Tell Class:  There is so much data being collected in the world around us. We can do remarkable things with this data.  We can ride all of the best rides at our favorite amusement park. We can create sinks and toilets that work without us having to touch them. 
*Teacher directions for #4:*  
*•	Capture/write how class thinks sensor data can be used to change the world.*

Ask Class:  
•	What would you like to do with magic band data?	Groups

Ask Class:  
•	Can anyone think of an example of other sensor technology?
•	Cannot think of anything?  
•	Fitbits, Nike Fuel Bands? 
•	What about cell phones? 

Tell Class:  Now that we have examples ….what do you think some of the challenges with this kind of data?

Ask Class:  
•	Has anyone ever thought about …
•	How you can use this technology to get better at sports?  
•	How you can use this technology to learn more about how people act?
•	Where does all that invisible data live or where is it stored?

Tell Class:  All those fun things create DATA.  Big Data!

Ask Class:  So what makes sensor data BIG DATA?   A lot of it?  
•	Usage data from utility companies  
•	Sensor data from athletes and athletic stadiums
•	Sensor data from animals in the wild
•	Sensor data from sattellites

Tell Class:  
•	Did you know that sensor data is used to help predict natural disasters and provide early warning in developing countries to save lives?
•	Did you know sensor data is used to evaluate environmental safety in wildfire zones? 

Ask Class:  Where does that data go?  Where is it stored?  

Tell Class:  This is what EMC does!  We help companies store, share, sort, and analyze data!

**Section Close:**

8.	Ask Class:  Considering how big EMC is….do you think all this data that is being created is valuable?  Why would Big Data Matter?  
Do you think it matters how the data is USED?   How can the data be used?
